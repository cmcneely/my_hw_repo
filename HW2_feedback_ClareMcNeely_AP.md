Great job overall, just had a few points to consider and worth noting: <br>
Q8: What you can also do is plot a bunch of histograms that would visually show you what the distributions looked like for all the variables. (df.hist()) <br>
Q10: What sorts of things can you do to try to correct for skewness in data, and normalize it? (ie. remove outliers, log-transform data, or some other type of mathematical conversion) <br>
Q11/Q12: Despite this data set not having the highest correlated varibables, what would you do with collinear variables? Keep all, some or none of them?
