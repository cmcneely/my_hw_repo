This is excellent work! So incredibly thorough and well thought out. This reminds me of a project that I did on some home depot product search relevance competition. You have pretty much conquered all the avenues of 'predicting' best_new_music. <br>
If you have time I would say you can try to have some extra fun with it. Try some unsupervised models, see if you can cluster these reviews based on your vectorized data, and see how accurately they fit the original music categories. Alternatively, try to see if you can predict the author of a review simply based on the words of their reviews... do they all have a 'style' or do they vary all over the place?
